# SCA-Cloud-School-Application

This is a technical assessment for SCA Cloud School Assessment for Cohort 2.
## Goal
To containerize a flask web application into a docker container.

# Prerequisites
* Install Docker on your machine, [see installation guide here]()
* Install Python 3.9, [see installation guide here]()
* Working knowledge on how to use Docker
* Basic understanding of how a flask application is structured

# Run Locally
* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FaithKovi/SCA-Cloud-School-Application.git
```
* Create and checkout to the Start branch
```
git branch Start
git checkout Start
```
* Create a folder
```
mkdir docker
cd docker
```
* Run the application
```python
    python app.py
```





# Docker Container 1
* Build docker image
```bash
    sudo docker build -t sca-cloud-image-1 .
```





* After successful creation, the output;
```
   Successfully built 901a3494de78
   Successfully tagged sca-cloud-image-1:latest
```
![sca-cloud-image-1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqWAyki4Vw-2-LBLbc8s5qMo8F3j2m-N/view?usp=drivesdk)
* The docker container was built using the Dockerfile and the application in a folder called docker. In the docker folder, run;
```bash
    sudo docker run --name sca-cloud-container-1 sca-cloud-image-1
```
![container-1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wmWI4aduFtyUVV2psOLzs9USRITrbR3c/view?usp=drivesdk)
* Output of container 1
